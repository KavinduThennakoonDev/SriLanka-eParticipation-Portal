            public forums, and focus group discussions, provide channels for you
            to share your feedback with the Government. Feedback received will
            be recorded (whether through the use of audio/sound recordings or in
            writing) by ConnectSL and surfaced to relevant agencies. We also
            facilitate communication between citizens and agencies by
